              <h3>・Bagel Bar Product And Logo Design・</h3>

                    <p>Process of how the Bagel Bar logo was made, along with sample images of mock-ups and the designs of bagel boxes and takeaway coffee cups for the cafe. This project was done outside of school in order for me to understand the basics of graphic design and how I can build up graphics from simple lines and images I had on my laptop into something that is for commerical use.</p>
              <h3>・Game Character・</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/plague boi.jpg" alt="image of a small plague doctor"></p>
                  <p>A drawing sketch of a Plague Doctor character from a game I used to play. This game is now roughly 9 years old and I used to play it when I was younger. It has gained popularity over the years and I saw the character design for it on my Instagram feed many times; I decided to make a little sketch of what I remember my character looked like while I was still playing the game, just for nostalgia.</p>

              <h3>・Photography Project・</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/project.jpg" alt="collection of images arranged to display a portrait"></p>
                  <p>A portrait compromised of numerous smaller portraits and headshots of people around the AUC campus edited with Photoshop. I had gone to a summer camp in order to improve my photography skills and the final assignment was to combine images in Photoshop in order to make it as if the final image was made of numerous small pictures.</p>
              <h3>・Flower Shop Logo Design・</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/original digital.JPG" alt="collection of images arranged to display a portrait"></p>
                  <p>A collection of flower clipart images altered and edited to fit as a logo for a flowershop. I was assigned to make a business card for a company which sells flowers. I had combined numerous cliparts of flowers I had found online for Creative Use in order to see what would work and what wouldn't work out correctly; using that clipart collage I was able to determine the colour scheme of the business.</p>
              <h3>・Quick Still-Life Sketch・</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/plant sketch.JPG" alt="sketch of potted plants"></p>
                  <p>A quick sketch of the potted plants under my windowsill. These potted plants are placed on top of a bookshelf. THis was part of an extracurricular project in which I had to depict what home means to me. Since my house was filled with all sorts of green plants, flowers, and cacti, it felt appropriate to have a rough sketch of the window with the most plants underneath it, which is in the living room. I've moved houses now and that window doesn't have as many plants as it did before but my house is still flourishing with plants. </p>

                <h3>・Crystals・</h3>
                  <p><img src="./images/image1 (1).jpg" alt="watercoloured crystals"></p>
                    <p>Watercolours blended together to show hue and blending of colours. This was inspired by a phase I had where I was infatuated with crystals and the amount of colours that a single crystal can have and how all these coulours blend almost perfectly with each other. Therefore, I tried my best to replicate the fluidity of colours crystals have using watercolours.</p>
                <h3>・Still-Life of Traditional Russian Ornaments・</h3>
                   <p><img src="./images/image2 (1).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                    <p>Practice for still-life drawing and painting using traditional Russian ornaments and table cloth with traditional Russian sewing pattern. It was a challenge for myself to paint still life with all the proper shadings with the help of the lighting along with the fact that were numerous objects in front of me. Since all the objects in front of me were not of a typical square or circular shape it was quite difficult to get the shading correct and the dark and light spots on the vase, wicker basket, and the cloth on the table and background.</p>

                <h3>・Mosaic Still-Life・</h3>
                  <p><img src="./images/image4 (1).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                    <p>Practice of still-life painting using the mosaic technique by painting in geometrical shapes to fill in an objects colour. This was another challenge for me since it was the first time I had freehanded painting in strict shapes. It was especially difficult to paint the flower vase since the vase has both circular and downward movement. The rest of the objects were easy to paint since they have still patches and their colours aren't as transparent or fluid as the vase.</p>
                <h3>・Static Scenery・</h3>
                  <p><img src="./images/image4 (2).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                    <p>Watercolour painting of a scenery from a game I had watched a playthrough of. In the game, the colour scheme was cool with a splash of pink and red whenever the sun would set and time was stationary, as if someone was stuck at one point in time. What appealed to me about the scenery of this game was how fluid the surroundings seem, the grass, trees, and sky, despite the game time itself being stationary and not moving forward.</p>

              <h3>Parrot</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image4 (3).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>A drawn version of a parrot I had seen while I was travelling and touring through Istanbul, Turkey. Unlike the parrots I have seen before in Egypt, this one had pink and read feathers and stood out in the daylight. I took a photo of it and set out to work on it using oil pastels to show how much the colours of this parrot stood out. The leaves and branches in the background serve as to show the contrast between the colours of the bird and the sky.</p>
              <h3>Sunflowers</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image3 (1).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>An oil pastel drawing of sunflowers. It is a reimagining of Van Gogh's sunflowers inspired by the countryside of Moldova (which is rich in sunflowers), with a much cooler background and a focus on one of the sunflowers rather than a collection of multiple sunflowers in a vase. This painting was mainly inspired by the rows and rows of sunflowers I had seen on the Moldovan countryside as we were having a roadtrip from one city to another to reach a relative's house.</p>
              <h3>Sea Cliff</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image2 (3).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>An oil pastel painting of a seaside cliff I had seen while on a roadtrip to a different city while my family and I were on vacation in Azerbaijan. It was late night by the time we reached our destination, and we were driving by cliffsides that were close to the sea since that was the fastest route to the next city. The light of the full moon that night made the waves look entrancing and the scene itself was breathtaking, to be so close to the sea yet so far away.</p>
              <h3>Mentor's Portrait</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image1.jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>An oil painting portrait of my mentor during the summer of 2018. As my final challenge for this art course, I had to paint a live portrait of my mentor using oil paints. I had never done any portraits of anyone and had a small basic understanding of oil paints from a project I had done before, so this was a challenge for me. The final product turned out to be a lot better than I had thought it would turn out to be.</p>

              <h3>Christmas</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image1 (3).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>This was a quick pastel sketch done in the Romanian airport while waiting for the next flight. My mum and I had a transit of 8 hours and I didn't have a visa to be able to exit the airport, so we stayed inside. It was close to Christmas time and the entire airport was decorated with Christmas trees, wreaths, ornaments, and lights. I found it fasinating how bright and spacious the airport seemed with the help of these decorations despite being a small area for the DutyFree. I had wantd to remember this place so I drew some of the decorations and ornaments that were close to where my mum and I were sitting.</p>
              <h3>Night Out</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image0 (1).jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>This is a repainting of Van Gogh's "Café Terrace at Night"; this was my first experiment and trial of painting with oil paints. This painting had helped me understand better how to use oil paint, how to mix and which brushes work best with this type of paint. This painting was a learning experience and I am proud with the way it turned out, despite not being an exact replica of the original but having my interpretation on it.</p>
              <h3>My Second Home</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image3.jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>An entry for an art competition that was held by the Ministry of Education. The topic for the competition was to visually represent your home. Since Qatar is my home, along with my home country Egypt, I had painted one of its national animals, the falcon, along with the famous Corniche view, which accurately represents how I see Qatar.</p>
              <h3>Cherry Blossom in Spring</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/image4.jpg" alt="watercoloured still-life"></p>
                  <p>I had watched a TV show where a tree was a majot plot point, and it had characteristics of a cherry blossom tree. The tree was the link to all life, and that for every blossom that blooms a new life is created, and for every flower that gets blown away a life is taken away, either by natural means or forcefully. This painting was inspired by that tree; the tree lays undisturbed in an isolated area guarded by a select group of people in the fear that if someone or something were to rock it or touch one of the branches then there would be mass genocide of all species. In the painting, the tree is on a desolate hill where nothing but the wind disturbs it; no animals or critters to accidentally scratch at the bark or birds to settle on the branches and cause the blossoms to fall.</p>
